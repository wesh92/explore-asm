 Exploring Assembly in my free time.

### To use:

`docker build -t asm-examples:latest .`

`docker run -idt -v path/to/root:/root asm-examples:latest `

You can also use the absolute path above depending on your needs.

I recommend using VSCode and popping into your container with it using `F1 -> Dev Containers Attach to Running Container`!
